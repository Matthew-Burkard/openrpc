# Discover and Docs

The [OpenRPC spec](https://spec.open-rpc.org/) defines a method called `rpc.discover`
which returns an [OpenRPC Document](https://spec.open-rpc.org/#openrpc-document)
describing the API.

The `rpc.discover` method is automatically generated using type annotations.

## Playground

The [OpenRPC Playground](https://github.com/open-rpc/playground) can be used as
interactive docs for your OpenRPC server.
